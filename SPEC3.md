More feedback I received

- The actions should be visible by default, its hard for feature discoverability
- The left pane, forge placement feels weird , can we put more size to the bar either or correct the logo positionin
- I need a add column button , basically i can click on it and either it can be an AI column that takes in a prompt as instrution, or it could be seleciting a column. So it could be like + shows which column extra to add and hrere is a sparkle with a text box where i cantype in anything
- The right side pane, doenst look as consistent with the UI in the middle plane you know, it feels not polished compared to the rest, also make it open by default

- Now regarding the middle pane, cowork as an option doesnt make sense anymore since on click it expands to the full screen view, that should just throw me into cowork mode directly i think, so the button there doesnt make sense
- Make the right pane of the main view and cowork view same width
- Are all the artifacts on cowork mode editable, i dont think so, double check on that
- I also have issues with some artifacts being like non work items, like timeline is not a artifact you know
- canvas, mail, excel, markdown doc, etc these are artifacts
- Its artifacts that agent and me is coworking on

- And another thing thats missing in cowork is the agents thought process and work behind it, the thouht chains and so right now i see a small blcok of summary,,but ideally it shuld have been agents actions and thoughts and reasoning chain, data it grabbed and read throug (whihc is an action as well)
- So how i am thinking about it is , you see the artifact to be reviewed and get going, but if i scroll upwards i can see the thought chain that lead to it, so its like where i am concepturally is in the middle of the page where the artifact is to be reviewed, from the agents perspective actions have preceeded it and i am going in and coworking. I am not sure how much clarity i have on this experience, but feels like something is there. Cause i really want the artifact to be there and conversations that follow after it seem a bit pointless


The product context that I missed here is that, there is a background team that actually hooks upto every surface, meetings email CRM slack etc. And can process that data analyze things and draft things recommend next steps, just needs approval at each stage to commit those actions. This interface is like that then. If a sales guys job was redefined so that every work work he had to do is done by a team who has no authority to get actions done without approval
