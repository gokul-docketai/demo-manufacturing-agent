I am trying to build an AI native workspace for sellers that are action oriented
A dashboard where they can go in and get things moving, and every work they had to do was done and have a person behind this scenes prepped everything for them
The only thing they actually have to do is maybe approve, give immediate next step guidance or feedback,review and if something has messed up go into a cowork mode

So yeah this is imagining a dashboard where all work is taken care of for the seller, they just have to get things moving to the next stage

So here is the basic frame i had in mind
<img1>

Now let me explain things

So how I'm thinking about this is Mm. there is that bar that you see, right? It's actually navigable. You can see I've split up as four sections So those four sections indicate each stage and I click on it I see cars belonging to that stage only. Um, and you got four of that so what you see is the set left pin Bottom half. left pin upper half is the core part of the application if you think about it Those are the high priority items across all stages that I should be Tending to. - So here is how I am thinking of it from a product perspective. It is that As a user, my eyes fall on what are the things I should be looking at and I should be moving to get like out of my way first across the board. so that My bare minimum for today is done. then I can feel like pushing more of the day like more work of the day and I can choose which stage Uh... Look, I kinda wanna... Tackle first. and then get those things approved and moving So that's the left pin. the right pane there is a collapsible A bar, make sure it's a collapsible bar Uh, Uh, So in the default view which I would refer as action mode So in action mode that is generic AI bar where you can just talk about anything really Like Uh, you're talking with the AI agent directly that controls the platform, let's say. So you don't just put a fucking empty Chat. section there. It's for now For all purposes, just to show peace. Um, Next I'll explain how the cards work. So the cards when clicked kind of have this Powering pop-up view, let's say. A card has the stage in it. So the stage as I indicated is early stage, internal team resolution, code generation, late stage. I'll explain what those are in a bit but for now I'll stick with what the card means here. So the card has stage which is one of these four It has a title and then it has a very short TLDR, something that I can quickly glance over and immediately know This is what the thing is talking about and this is the action that I'm approving or co-working on. It needs to be really concise. I am gonna spend literally a... split second glancing over those cards. It needs to be really concise. Those are the cards. - those are the cards that you see entirely on the action mode so when i click on it it opens up to a better view and i can scroll those scroll through those things Uh... and look at the artifact and approve. But Here is the transition to the deeper workflow which is co-work If I feel like the artifact that it has generated and is waiting for me to approve is if i feel like it's bad what i can do is i'll hit co-work and it will move to a co-work mode where the pin the right pane is basically The copilot mode and left is basically the space where the agent gets to defend its artifact and I can work with it. So it's like, it's its computer screen. We are in a Google Meet, let's say. That is the best way I could-- compared to stud So left pane is the workspace, the right side is me interacting with the copilot. I also get to go and modify things on the left pane. So like if it's an Excel sheet that it's popping up, I can go to the left pane and edit that as well. but I can also make the agent do things from the right way. So that's co-work mode. So Co-work mode, the philosophy I have here is that uh action mode i get things moving really fast and if i ever need to micromanage things i'll go to co-work mode micromanage it then immediately get out of it As in I approve it and then get out of it. or whatever that is 

Okay, so I noticed that I didn't speak about what i think about these stages they are actually completely random not random they are arbitrary those are my best guesses on what could be stages that are Uh, partitioned in a sales guy's head. So maybe I would like to tackle some early stage work such as so what do i talk about mean by early stage work Establish an intro, having the first few calls happen, that's what I think of as early stage calls or actions. work Internal team resolution is when I need a solutions consultant to solution things. - Some random ass team struggle and then code generations is all discussions or work relating to code generation aspect. not code, quote, Q-U-O-T-E. and then lay stages when i am going through conversations to close the deal so those kind of works belonging to those cards belong to that cluster

I want this to be inspired by obsidian like design language with warm tones in light mode.

Build this using shadcn

This is more like a mock up UI so do not bother creating a backend that is functional, but I would like enough depth to the things mocked where it feels like an application of substance i can demo on call
