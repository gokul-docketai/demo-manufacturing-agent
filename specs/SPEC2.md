I have a few changes coming from product review

We are moving away from a card centric view to a list centric view for the overall experience
Lets take the top and the bottom cards section
We can divide the top part to 2 sections. Left top pane, Right top pane
Left top pane list view contains what the existing cards used to, but just a list now (do not remove the fkin buttons)

The top right pane is something called accout to look at, this gives me a account level POV

In the bottom list, i want a feature called AI Columns. AI columns are like indicated by the AI sparkle right left to the column name. Lets introduce one of those. But yeah generally keep everything else the same

When i click on the card(now list) it should expand to take up the entire screen, like how cowork would. Lets remove that pop up kind of experience

We need a new rework button along with cowork and approve

Can we also have a mock sidebar to the left
Top having a home and bottom having a settings and profile
It should be just logos inactive, when mouse hovers to that region, it expands to show the name with the icon

So for stages, we call it: Early Stage, Internal Team, Quote Generation,etc. Can we name it something more manufacturing sales flow and deal cycle relevant, im not sure what those are. But I am going to demo this for folks in those areas for now so demo data and usecases being those (cards and data) would be nice.

We need a canvas view usecase for the card/cowork thing, imagine a maufactuinr gusecase where it is taking an engineering diagram, representing the cad diagram for it and making a engineering specification for it to be approved. So the canvas like AI experience would show the engineering diagram beign rendered there ig

I need the excel like and table view to have the AI columns as well.
In cowork mode, i want the excel to be editable

When i click on the card(now list) it should expand to take up the entire screen, like how cowork would. Lets remove that pop up kind of experience
